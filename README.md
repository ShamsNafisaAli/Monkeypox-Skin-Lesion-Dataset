This repository gives access to the Moneypox Skin Lesion Dataset. The dataset itself is available for download at the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafin59/monkeypox-skin-lesion-dataset) or the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bIYqAW-vqDBq3Ou_UMXPwgemqfZeqQi5?usp=sharing).

## Requirements
- Python 
- Matlab 
- Keras 
- Tensorflow 
- Sklearn 
- Tensorboard


## How To Run
<!-- ### Data Preparation:
- First download the PHS Data (Processed) and ICBHI Dataset (Processed) folder from this GoogleDrive Link
- Update the definition of path_Heart_Train and path_Lung_Train of config.py inside Codes folder
Place Physionet dataset (not included in the provided data folder) in the corresponding folders inside the data/physionet/training folder. The csv files containing the labels should be put inside the corresponding folders inside the labels folder and all of them should have the same name, currently 'REFERENCE_withSQI.csv'. If you change the name you'll have to rename the variable labelpath in extract_segments.m and extract_segments_noFIR.m
Run extract_segments_noFIR.m it first then run data_fold_noFIR.m to create data fold in mat format which will be loaded by the model for training and testing. fold0_noFIR.mat is given inside data/feature/folds for convenience, so that you don't have to download the whole physionet dataset and extract data for training and testing. -->
