The recent monkeypox outbreak has become a global healthcare concern owing to its rapid spread in more than 65 countries around the globe. To obstruct its expeditious pace, early diagnosis is a must. But the confirmatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests and other biochemical assays are not readily available in suffiecient quantities. In this scenario, computer-aided monkeypox identification from skin lesion images can be a beneficial measure. Nevertheless, so far, such datasets are not available. Hence, the "Moneypox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD)" is created by collecting and processing images from different means of web-scrapping i.e., from news portals, websites and publicly accessible case reports.


This repository gives access to the [Moneypox Skin Lesion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafin59/monkeypox-skin-lesion-dataset). The creation of this dataset is primarily focused on distinguishing the monkeypox cases from the similar non-monkeypox cases. Therefore, along with the 'Monkeypox' class, we included skin lesion images of 'Chickenpox' and 'Measles' because of their resemblance to the monkeypox rash and pustules in initial state in another class named 'Others' to perform binary classification.

The dataset itself is available for download at the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafin59/monkeypox-skin-lesion-dataset) or the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bIYqAW-vqDBq3Ou_UMXPwgemqfZeqQi5?usp=sharing).
